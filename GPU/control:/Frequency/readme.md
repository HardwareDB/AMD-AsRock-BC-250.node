>A GPU governor is available here. You should use it. Values are set in /etc/oberon-governor.yaml.
>You can also use the following commands to set the clocks manually:
>```
>echo vc 0 <CLOCK> <VOLTAGE> > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.1/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage
>echo c > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.1/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage
>```
